## Technology
#### Client side :
The client side is written in React. I found that React is the most comfortable platform to use for state controller in my app.
 #### Server side :
The server side is written in TypeScript and compiled into NodeJS through a gulp file. 
I  Scrape food delivery Websites Using Node.js and Puppeteer 
to store the data in my DB( PostgreSQL ) and used google API to render the restaurants by location.
